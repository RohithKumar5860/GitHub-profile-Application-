  Summary 
</h3>
<p>
  This GitHub profile search application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive way to explore GitHub user profiles. By integrating the GitHub API, it fetches and displays user information, including their avatar, bio, repository count, follower stats, and a list of public repositories. The design ensures a clean, responsive interface, enabling seamless interaction across devices.

When a username is entered, the app dynamically updates the page with fetched data or displays an error if the user isn't found. The CSS ensures visually appealing layouts, while JavaScript handles API integration, data processing, and event-driven updates. This project demonstrates practical API usage and is a great addition to portfolios, showcasing skills in frontend development and real-time data handling.
